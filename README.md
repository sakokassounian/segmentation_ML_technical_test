## Choreograph technical exam
I applied for a Data Scientist position with the Audience Origin team at Choreograph, where the assessment involved selecting and completing two out of three provided questions. The tasks focused on analyzing different weighting impacts, segmenting data based on Covid attitudes and financial measures, and assessing the quality of survey responses. The results were to be presented in slides, with a scripts attached. The interview included a presentation of my findings followed by a discussion session.
